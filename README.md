# beanie-recipe-book
This is just a "play around and see what I can get working project"
Idea is to creare a basic app that
it is indeed a recipe book using beanie, mongo and fastAPI
Step 1 
  is to get MongoDB running in a Docker contaniner, with volume to give disk backing 
  Beanie python container talking to it and just populating a basic collection
Step 2 
  Add fast API so that REST API can be added to retrieve / update / delete recipes
  turn into Docker Compose
Step 3
  move from Docker Compose to k3s
Step 4
  add a basic React/Vue front end
